  description: "This workshop is an introduction to the Julia programming language for people familiar with R, Python, or MATLAB. Compared to those languages, Julia code typically runs orders of magnitude faster but has a similar level of abstraction, so you can focus on your research problem rather than hardware minutiae. Julia also provides out-of-the-box Unicode support, an easy-to-use package manager, multithreading facilities, a macro system, and a rich type system to optimize and prevent bugs in your code. Workshop topics include a concise overview of Julia's syntax and features, an end-to-end introduction to using built-in functions and contributed packages to read, summarize, and visualize tabular data, and real-world examples where we've found Julia beneficial."

  description: "All of Us (AoU) Research Program, is a National Institutes of Health (NIH) program that aims to enroll one million diverse participants to address historical gaps in medical research. The goal of the program is better health for all of us. Its mission is to accelerate health research and medical breakthroughs, enabling individualized prevention, treatment, and care for all. The program does this by leveraging the power of cloud computing, the program facilitates extensive collaborations and robust analyses. AoU compiles a comprehensive dataset (the All of Us Researcher Workbench) which includes survey responses, physical measurements, bio samples, Electronic Health Records (EHRs), and genomic data. As of November 2023, All of Us boasts over 741,000 enrolled participants, with 508,000 completing initial program steps, over 409,000 electronic medical records, and 525,000 bio samples. Notably, 75% of participants with available data on the All of Us Researcher Workbench identify with underrepresented communities, and 45% belong to racial and ethnic minority groups.

The All of Us program provides a user-friendly environment for researchers to use the database through the All of Us Researcher Workbench. This platform offers an accessible and secure space to conduct analyses, ensuring that the wealth of data collected is readily available for scientific exploration. This dataset provides a significant step toward fostering innovation and cultivating a comprehensive understanding of health determinants in diverse populations. By encompassing this broad spectrum of health-related data, the All of Us dataset opens doors for a myriad of analyses, including Exposure Assessment, Health Disparities, Environmental Justice, Genetic-Environmental Interactions, and Behavioral Responses to Environmental Factors.

Session Content:
In the first hour, we will deliver an informative presentation covering the purpose All of Us program, the available participant data and resources, and key benefits for researchers. Additionally, we will showcase various research examples conducted using this extensive database.

The second hour, we will focus on guiding participants through enrollment including where to access the database. We will elaborate on the different tools and resources available which provide insights into the workbench. This will include a detailed presentation on creating cohorts and datasets and instructions on exporting data for further analysis.

This workshop is particularly relevant for researchers and students engaged in various fields, including public health, epidemiology, medicine, genetics, psychology, and any area where data from Fitbit, medical records, genetics, and social health determinants play a crucial role."

  description: "First Session: Sharing and reusing data can effectively reduce redundant efforts in data collection, ultimately saving valuable time and resources, especially for smaller laboratories. Additionally, it enhances the efficiency of scientific research investments by preventing the reinvention of the wheel. Building a sustainable data-reuse process and culture relies on frameworks that comprise policies, standards, roles, and responsibilities, all of which must address the diverse needs of data providers, curators, and (re)users alike. A critical step in the data sharing and (re)use cycle involves researchers identifying data that are (re)usable for their needs. It is a common challenge among researchers to locate data that appear (re)usable. In this session, I aim to introduce 2-3 data repositories ideal for researchers seeking (re)usable data for their studies. Additionally, I will offer several tips and strategies for identifying and utilizing (re)usable data effectively. The session is structured to last approximately 45 minutes, encompassing a 25-minute presentation, a 5-minute question-and-answer segment, and a 10-minute practical workshop exercise. Second Session: Social media is increasingly becoming an important site for data collection and research for students, researchers, and scholars across the Humanities and Social Sciences. This workshop introduces participants to the existing landscape of social media data and the fluctuating access academics have to ‘big datasets’. Using Facebook, Twitter (or X), and Reddit as examples of data archives, we discuss the latest guidelines and restrictions on scraping social media data from these three platforms and how they affect researchers conducting social media research. The workshop urges participants to rethink their notion of “Data” concerning social media to foreground the issue of research ethics that is often sidestepped or not taken seriously due to the presumed publicness of social media data."
