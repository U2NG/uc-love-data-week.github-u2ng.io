  description:  In late 2020 the NIH announced their new Policy for Data Management and Sharing. Starting in 2023, this policy will require all NIH researchers to prospectively plan for how their scientific data will be preserved and shared through submission of a Data Management and Sharing Plan. While they might not be required by the NIH for two years, we encourage researchers to start writing data management plans now as they are a useful tool for planning and tracking research data.This session will give an overview of data management plans (DMPs), dive deep into the new NIH requirements, and share local resources and tools like DMPTool.

  description:  twarc is a command line tool and Python library for gathering and working with Twitter JSON data via the public Twitter API. Emerging from the Black Lives Matter and Document the Now movements, twarc comes along with a loose set of community standards that respect the autonomy of the user and aligns with the EU's GDPR and Twitter's terms of service.  As part of supporting social media research, the UCSB Library Collaboratory will get you started with what you need to use twarc and present current ethical best practices that we use to orient researchers to social media research.

  day:  f
  time:   10:00 am - Noon
  start: 10
  duration: 120
  type:  hands-on
  description:  This workshop covers an introduction to natural language processing (NLP) and caveats for its application to health data. Using the R programming language we will introduce the basics of text processing and demo how to calculate common metrics including word frequencies, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF), and principal component analysis (PCA) to explore important words and group similar documents. We will also introduce more advanced NLP topics (sentiment analysis, topic modeling, etc.) and discuss classical versus deep learning approaches, as time permits. Learners with proficient R skills are encouraged to code along.

  description:  This workshop will teach you how to gather information from websites using tools available in the R programmming language. You'll learn how scrape data from web tables using the rvest package, and how to track the social media trends captured in Twitter hashtags using the rtweet package. The workshop is geared towards intermediate R users, but we welcome a wide audience to join us and observe the demonstrations.

  description:  Have you ever wanted to harvest data off a website that was not already in an analysis-friendly format? If so, this web scraping workshop is for you! Web scraping can be done entirely manually but it is usually faster, more efficient and less error-prone if automated. UCSB Research Data Services will navigate you through some basic web scraping techniques including how to use XPath and the Chrome web browser with the Scraper extension to extract data from the web with little technical knowlege.  We will also discuss the ethical issues of web scraping.

  description:  This workshop will unpack the subjective process of data visualization and its relationship to concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion. We'll critically explore how data can be used to uphold and perpetuate, or quantify and demonstrate structural oppression. Through this workshop learners will practice the technique of "data visceralization," the process of experiencing differences in data and understanding them viscerally. This workshop is led by UC Davis DataLab's Data Feminism research and learning cluster, which focuses on thinking about data science and data ethics as informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism. Explore our Data Feminism reading list and activities, here.
