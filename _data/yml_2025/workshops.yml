  description: "APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) serve as powerful tools for accessing and interacting with data in a structured and automated manner, providing capabilities far beyond what is possible through traditional interfaces. Despite their ubiquity in software development, APIs remain underutilized in humanities research, where they offer immense potential for innovative data collection and analysis.

In this session, we’ll demystify APIs and showcase their potential through the Library of Congress API. Participants will see step-by-step how to identify if a collection has API access, construct requests, and interpret responses, all with tools like Postman. We’ll walk through concepts like authentication, endpoints, parameters, and how to transform JSON responses into tabular data for visualization.

This session is designed as a show-and-tell introduction—perfect for researchers and students with no prior coding or data analysis experience. By the end, attendees will have a clear understanding of how APIs work, their practical applications, and how to start integrating them into their research workflows. Get ready to see what APIs can do for your projects!"

Through invited speakers and workshopping problems and projects, we seek to cultivate an inclusive community at UCLA of transdisciplinary experimentation built on ethical engagement and thoughtful exchange. This presentation and discussion will share works in progress from some of the projects at UCLA as well as the conversation from our fall convening focused on broader questions related to data curation, production, circulation, and publishing in the realms of teaching and research. Some topics and projects discussed include sustainable and ethical collaborations and reciprocity, multilingual and multimodal data analysis and access, humanistic and literary data, global south and colonial knowledge. Critical Data Lab is convened by Cindy Nguyen and with support from UCLA DataX, Institute for Digital Research and Education, and Office of Advanced Research Computing.

This session will feature QualiAnon, an open-source tool designed to help researchers securely anonymize and pseudonymize sensitive qualitative data with precision and flexibility. Unlike automated tools that rely on blind substitutions, QualiAnon gives you full control over how and when data is anonymized, allowing you to manually define replacement rules for specific datasets or variables. This approach ensures a higher level of accuracy and privacy by stripping identifying information without compromising the richness of the data. In this session, we’ll demonstrate how QualiAnon can streamline your data protection efforts, improve your workflow, and ensure compliance with privacy standards. Don’t miss the chance to discover how this tool can simplify the de-identification process while safeguarding sensitive information in your research!"

Quarto enables a more reproducible approach to data-driven research by integrating documentation, code, and results in one document. But it’s also a great publication platform on its own! In this session a panel of Quarto users will showcase what Quarto is capable of, especially when used in concert with GitHub Pages hosting, including creating websites (course websites, personal websites, blogs), presentations, dashboards, academic papers, and books. We will also demonstrate, in real-time, how easy it is to create such research deliverables. Prepare to be sold on using Quarto!"

  description: 'Qualitative research encompasses many methodological approaches, and one of the most powerful is oral history. As described by the UC Berkeley Oral History Center, this approach involves producing "first-person narrative topical and life histories that explore the narrator’s understanding of events through a recorded interview...[this] results in a lightly edited transcript of the interview that the narrator reviews, which is then published." This differs from the more familiar qualitative research interview, in that it is a two-directional, and transparent process... which comes with its own challenges. In this workshop you will learn more about these synergies and contrasts between and within methods, hear more about best practices for conducting oral history projects, and have time to ask questions about project ideas of your own.'

We will explore the power structures that inform the human labor behind AI, as well as the impacts of AI development and use on natural ecosystems, systematic oppression, and information economies. We will also discuss the agency we retain as students, teachers, and lifelong learners to co-create critical frameworks that challenge the inevitability of robot overlords.

Currently, UCLA Library Special Collections is in the process of a multi-year effort to create digital records for its Islamic Manuscript holdings. At HumTech, our team is engaged in a project to visualize the cataloged manuscripts through Tableau. The goal of this project is to represent a birds eye view of the Islamic manuscript holdings for interested researchers. Through representation of multiple data points that the library cataloging process captured from the manuscripts, the visualization hopes to provide easy access to researchers for dissecting the data in multiple ways and helping them in drawing useful insights into the Islamic manuscript holdings at UCLA. In this presentation, we will be discussing the challenges that we faced in data cleaning, wrangling and visualization that are specific to manuscript collections, especially one that is primarily in non-Latin script and spans to the pre-modern period.

This session will start with a presentation and overview of the contents of the IDL and search interface. Next, we will introduce a python based, open-source stack researchers can use to analyze, transcribe, and categorize data in IDL video, audio, and image files. Although participants will have an opportunity to try out these technologies during the workshop, the primary focus will be an overview of available tools and data, and participation in the programming sections is optional.
