  duration: 90

  description: "This 5-part workshop series aims to help learners understand the relatively small but fundamental computational model underlying the R language. This will help you reason about code before you write and run it, and to debug it if it doesn’t do what you want. A sound understanding of this computational model makes programming in R much easier and more productive! This workshop series is intended for active engagement – be prepared to come to each session with questions about why some things worked, and others didn’t. All researchers (students, postdocs, faculty and staff) who meet the ‘prerequisites’ are welcome to register for this workshop series, which is being offered in person at the UC Davis DataLab, and will be broadcast as part of UC Love Data Week. An optional final 5th session will be offered entirely remotely for additional Q&A by all audiences. Learners who can attend all sessions will receive priority registration for the limited in person seats. Broadcast participants still need to register to receive the Zoom link."

We will focus primarily on unstructured text data, discussing how to format and clean text to enable the discovery of significant patterns in collections of documents. Sessions will introduce participants to core terminology in text mining/natural language processing and will walk through different methods of ranking terms and documents. We will conclude by using these methods to classify texts and to build models of 'topics.' Basic familiarity with Python is required. We welcome students, postdocs, faculty, and staff from a variety of research domains, ranging from health informatics to the humanities. This workshop occurs during UC Love Data Week, and all members of the University of California system are welcome to register."

However, due to unique circumstances for each respective discipline, these topics are often glanced over in traditional course curricula, and often absent from research discussion forums in academic settings. In this session, data librarians from UCLA and UC Berkeley will host an interdisciplinary discussion on data ethics and justice in research. Graduate researchers in STEM and humanities disciplines will present how their research intersects with ethical issues in data privacy and security. Following these presentations will be breakout discussions focused on the areas presented by the speakers. This session will foster conversation around addressing and taking action on issues of data ethics and justice in the UC-wide research community. This event is open to all UC researchers, staff and students and does not require background knowledge."

Come prepared to apply takeaways from the readings to unpacking provided case studies from the health sciences, and your own research processes. Researchers from all domains are welcome to participate. Together we’ll brainstorm how as individuals and a community we can contribute to more equitable data-driven research."

  description:  "GitHub is an online platform for software development using Git for version control. During this hands-on workshop we'll practice setting up, sharing, and collaboratively working on a repository for a research project. We'll explore different features for improving your workflows, whether you're working by yourself or with others on a data-driven project using GitHub. Prior to attending the live session learners will complete modules that cover setting up their GitHub account, obtaining their ssh keys, and onboarding to the workshop virtual classroom. Note: this is a small-format workshop and space is limited; applicants will be notified of their enrollment status and provided with the pre-workshop materials one week prior to the workshop. This workshop occurs during UC Love Data Week, and all members of the University of California system are welcome to register."

We will query an API based on search terms, examine and interpret JSON results, display results as a dataframe, and build functions to facilitate API call replicability.  If you are a beginner to APIs, and want to powerlevel your knowledge, the recording and slides to last year's UC Love Data Week's introductory API workshop are available, which covers how APIs work and API documentation.  Prerequisites for the workshop are - Basic understanding of how APIs work - Installation of Jupyter Notebooks with Python - Installation of the following packages - Beginner knowledge of Python (e.g. assign, for loops, functions, importing libraries)"
