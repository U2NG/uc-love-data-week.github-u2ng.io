  description: "This 5-part workshop series aims to help learners understand the relatively small but fundamental computational model underlying the R language. This will help you reason about code before you write and run it, and to debug it if it doesn’t do what you want. A sound understanding of this computational model makes programming in R much easier and more productive! This workshop series is intended for active engagement – be prepared to come to each session with questions about why some things worked, and others didn’t. All researchers (students, postdocs, faculty and staff) who meet the ‘prerequisites’ are welcome to register for this workshop series, which is being offered in person at the UC Davis DataLab, and will be broadcast as part of UC Love Data Week. An optional final 5th session will be offered entirely remotely for additional Q&A by all audiences. Learners who can attend all sessions will receive priority registration for the limited in person seats. Broadcast participants still need to register to receive the Zoom link."

We will focus primarily on unstructured text data, discussing how to format and clean text to enable the discovery of significant patterns in collections of documents. Sessions will introduce participants to core terminology in text mining/natural language processing and will walk through different methods of ranking terms and documents. We will conclude by using these methods to classify texts and to build models of 'topics.' Basic familiarity with Python is required. We welcome students, postdocs, faculty, and staff from a variety of research domains, ranging from health informatics to the humanities. This workshop occurs during UC Love Data Week, and all members of the University of California system are welcome to register."

However, due to unique circumstances for each respective discipline, these topics are often glanced over in traditional course curricula, and often absent from research discussion forums in academic settings. In this session, data librarians from UCLA and UC Berkeley will host an interdisciplinary discussion on data ethics and justice in research. Graduate researchers in STEM and humanities disciplines will present how their research intersects with ethical issues in data privacy and security. Following these presentations will be breakout discussions focused on the areas presented by the speakers. This session will foster conversation around addressing and taking action on issues of data ethics and justice in the UC-wide research community. This event is open to all UC researchers, staff and students and does not require background knowledge."

  description:  In late 2020 the NIH announced their new Policy for Data Management and Sharing. Starting in 2023, this policy will require all NIH researchers to prospectively plan for how their scientific data will be preserved and shared through submission of a Data Management and Sharing Plan. While they might not be required by the NIH for two years, we encourage researchers to start writing data management plans now as they are a useful tool for planning and tracking research data.This session will give an overview of data management plans (DMPs), dive deep into the new NIH requirements, and share local resources and tools like DMPTool.

  description:  twarc is a command line tool and Python library for gathering and working with Twitter JSON data via the public Twitter API. Emerging from the Black Lives Matter and Document the Now movements, twarc comes along with a loose set of community standards that respect the autonomy of the user and aligns with the EU's GDPR and Twitter's terms of service.  As part of supporting social media research, the UCSB Library Collaboratory will get you started with what you need to use twarc and present current ethical best practices that we use to orient researchers to social media research.

  day:  f
  time:   10:00 am - Noon
  start: 10
  duration: 120
  type:  hands-on
  description:  This workshop covers an introduction to natural language processing (NLP) and caveats for its application to health data. Using the R programming language we will introduce the basics of text processing and demo how to calculate common metrics including word frequencies, term frequency-inverse document frequency (TFIDF), and principal component analysis (PCA) to explore important words and group similar documents. We will also introduce more advanced NLP topics (sentiment analysis, topic modeling, etc.) and discuss classical versus deep learning approaches, as time permits. Learners with proficient R skills are encouraged to code along.

  temp:   DataLab Research and Learning Cluster for Health Data Science and Systems. RLC members have priority registration. Capped at 60 learners.

  description:  This workshop will teach you how to gather information from websites using tools available in the R programmming language. You'll learn how scrape data from web tables using the rvest package, and how to track the social media trends captured in Twitter hashtags using the rtweet package. The workshop is geared towards intermediate R users, but we welcome a wide audience to join us and observe the demonstrations.

  description:  Have you ever wanted to harvest data off a website that was not already in an analysis-friendly format? If so, this web scraping workshop is for you! Web scraping can be done entirely manually but it is usually faster, more efficient and less error-prone if automated. UCSB Research Data Services will navigate you through some basic web scraping techniques including how to use XPath and the Chrome web browser with the Scraper extension to extract data from the web with little technical knowlege.  We will also discuss the ethical issues of web scraping.

  description:  This workshop will unpack the subjective process of data visualization and its relationship to concepts of diversity, equity and inclusion. We'll critically explore how data can be used to uphold and perpetuate, or quantify and demonstrate structural oppression. Through this workshop learners will practice the technique of "data visceralization," the process of experiencing differences in data and understanding them viscerally. This workshop is led by UC Davis DataLab's Data Feminism research and learning cluster, which focuses on thinking about data science and data ethics as informed by the ideas of intersectional feminism. Explore our Data Feminism reading list and activities, here.
